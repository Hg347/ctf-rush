# Basic Rules of Capture the Flag

1. **Two Teams** – Players are divided into two groups, each assigned a territory.

2. **Flag Placement** – Each team hides or places their flag within their own territory.

3. **Objective** – The goal is to capture the opposing team's flag and return it to your own base without being tagged.

4. **Tagging & Jail** – If a player is tagged in enemy territory, they may be sent to a designated "jail" and must wait to be freed by a teammate.

5. **Winning the Game** – The first team to successfully capture the opponent’s flag and bring it back to their base wins.

This traditional outdoor game relies on teamwork, speed, and strategy to outmaneuver opponents and secure victory.
