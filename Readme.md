# CTF Rush - Capture the flag

CTF-Rush is a new variation of the traditional urban game [Capture the Flag (CTF)](./Ctf-Instruction.md). It integrates the possibilities of modern technologies, such as smartphones, making it a pervasive game.

The idea is to encourage children and young people to play together outdoors, in the real world, instead of just playing online games inside. We strongly believe that there is enormous potential in technology-sustained games to encourage everyday movement and play.

For more information about the traditional game, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag).
