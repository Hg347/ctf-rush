# Capture The Flag (CTF)


## Use Cases

### Use Case 1
The first use case describes how players can capture each other.
A captured player should move to the **other teams** jail. Only there 
the captured player can be freed by a team mate.
A player who is in status captured cannot capture any other player or
confirm the flag (refer to [use case 4](#use-case-4)).
In other words: the QR-Code scanning ability of a captured player is blocked.
